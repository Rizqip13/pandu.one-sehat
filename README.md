# PanduONE ‚Äî Early CKD Education Chatbot

PanduONE is an AI-powered chatbot designed to support early detection and daily management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Indonesia. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Gemini API and tailored local health education, PanduONE bridges gaps in misinformation, limited clinical consultation time, and low CKD awareness.

## üß† Why PanduONE?

Early-stage CKD is often asymptomatic, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed care. Patients struggle with:
- Limited consultation time with healthcare providers
- Misinformation from online sources
- Difficulty managing complex CKD regimens

PanduONE addresses these issues through an intelligent chatbot system, clinician-facing dashboard, and integration-ready design.
